# Wildflyer - Drone based Wildfire detection

Our goal is to aid in detection of wildfires using a drone which is equipped with a mobile weather station, to record temperature, winds and humidity. Using these measurements we try to predict the occurrence of wildfires at a certain point.

## Drone based collection

In addition to collecting atmospheric metrics, the drone keeps recording footage of the ground to detect actual fires to release an alert before a wildfire spreads.


## Prediction Techniques

Using AI - based prediction techniques and a historical record of frequency of wildfires, we can pinpoint the locations where it is most probable for wildfires to begin and regularly monitor those areas. Thus, instead of traversing the complete forest we look at only few destinations which are the most probable culprits.


Despite the drone being costly, we estimate that the financial damage prevented will far outweigh the cost of procurement. It will also help safeguard the environment and habitat of animals.
